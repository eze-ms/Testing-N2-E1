# Integer Assertion Tests

## 📄 Description
This Java project demonstrates the use of JUnit 5 and AssertJ for unit testing. It includes tests to verify equality and inequality between integers using fluent assertions. The exercise highlights the setup of a testing environment and the implementation of best practices in automated testing.

### Functionality
1. **Core Features:**
    - Verify that two integers are equal.
    - Verify that two integers are not equal.
    - Leverage AssertJ for fluent and expressive assertions.
    - Use JUnit 5 for structured and maintainable tests.

2. **Robust Design:**
    - Ensures proper validation of integer comparisons.
    - Implements clear test structures for learning purposes.
    - Provides reusable test cases with automated validation.
